I appeal to everyone who can help.I live in Baku, Azerbaijan. It’s hard to find parts for old models. I ask everyone who can help with spare parts. You can write on Instagram @emiloasis and Facebook Emil Huseynov. E-mail : estet79@mail.ru ; They probably didn’t accept me in a cut ... ; My car is from Germany. Who can tell by the number of the body you can find the first owners? ; google--->Audi7zap
